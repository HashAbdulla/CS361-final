## 🛡️ INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY: Core Overview

### 📌 Definition

Protects physical & virtual components (hardware, software, networks, data centers, cloud services) that support an organization's IT environment.

### 🎯 Goals (CIA + Compliance)

* **Confidentiality** – Prevent unauthorized access
* **Integrity** – Ensure data accuracy and trustworthiness
* **Availability** – Ensure systems/data are accessible when needed
* **Compliance** – Meet regulatory standards (e.g., PCI DSS, NIST)

---

## 🚨 WHY IT MATTERS

* **Business Continuity** – Avoids costly downtime
* **Data Protection** – Safeguards customer/organizational data
* **Regulatory Compliance** – Prevents fines, lawsuits
* **Reputation Management** – Prevents customer trust loss

## 🔓 IMPACT OF BREACHES

| Impact Type          | Examples/Details                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 💰 Financial Loss    | Fines, lawsuits, recovery costs         |
| 🗂️ Data Loss        | Critical business or personal data loss |
| ⛔ Operational Impact | Downtime, halted services               |

## ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

### 🔄 1. Updates & Patch Management

* Keep all systems/software current
* Use automated patching tools

🧠 Case Study: **Equifax breach** happened due to an unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability

---

### 🔐 2. Strong Access Controls

* **Least privilege** principle
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
* Scenario Tip: Enforce MFA for ShopSmart’s admin dashboard access

---

### 🔀 3. Network Segmentation

* Isolates networks to contain breaches
* Ex: Guest Wi-Fi ≠ Internal Network

🧠 Case Study: Marriott breach exposed customer data due to lack of segmentation after an acquisition

---

### 📡 4. Security Monitoring & Incident Response

* Use **SIEM** systems (e.g., UTMStack)
* Incident response steps:

  * Detection
  * Containment
  * Eradication
  * Recovery

---

### 🧠 5. Employee Training & Awareness

* Phishing simulations
* Secure password protocols
* Encourage suspicious activity reporting

🧠 Human error = Top breach cause

---

### 🔒 6. Data Encryption

* **At Rest** – Stored data (e.g., database)
* **In Transit** – Data over network (e.g., SSL, HTTPS)

---

### 🗂️ 7. Backup & Recovery

* Regular backups
* Offsite or cloud-based recovery systems

🧠 Scenario Tip: Set up encrypted, offsite backups for ShopSmart's customer database

---

### 📋 8. Compliance & Auditing

* Frameworks: **ISO 27001**, **NIST**, **PCI DSS**
* Regular audits help detect and fix gaps
