# ‚úÖ MASTER NOTES: Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)

---

## üìå 1. **What Is VAPT?**

* **VAPT = Vulnerability Assessment + Penetration Testing**

  * **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify and prioritize known security flaws.
  * **Penetration Testing**: Ethically exploit vulnerabilities to simulate real attacks.
* **Goal**: Strengthen security posture by identifying weaknesses before attackers do.

## üö® 2. **Why VAPT Matters for CISOs**

| Purpose                 | Benefit                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Risk Identification** | Early detection of threats; prioritize remediation by severity.             |
| **Compliance**          | Required for **GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA**. Avoid legal and financial penalties. |
| **Customer Trust**      | Demonstrates proactive security ‚Üí enhances reputation.                      |

## üéØ 4. **Types of Penetration Testing**

| Type          | Description                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Black Box** | No internal knowledge. Mimics an outsider.                                    |
| **White Box** | Full access to internal details. Ideal for in-depth audits.                   |
| **Gray Box**  | Partial knowledge (e.g., login credentials). Simulates insider threat.        |
| **External**  | Tests internet-facing assets (websites, servers).                             |
| **Internal**  | Simulates insider threats from within the network.                            |
| **Blind**     | Security team unaware of the test. Evaluates incident detection and response. |

## üß™ 5. **Penetration Testing Phases (CISO Focus)**

| Phase                     | Key Actions                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Planning**           | Define scope, gather IPs/domains, choose testing tools.                                      |
| **2. Scanning**           | Discover open ports, services, OS fingerprinting (e.g., with **Nmap**).                      |
| **3. Gaining Access**     | Exploit weaknesses: SQLi, buffer overflows, password cracking.                               |
| **4. Maintaining Access** | Establish persistence (e.g., backdoors, reverse shells).                                     |
| **5. Reporting**          | Provide risk-ranked findings + remediation plan. Present results to both execs & tech teams. |
